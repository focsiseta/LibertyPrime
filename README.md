# LibertyPrime

LibertyPrime is an attempt to create a simple library to build WebGL things and I'm using it as base for my CG uni project

I will write some sort of documentation sometime in the future 


# Bugs

  . Shader's attribute/uniforms parser somehow doesn't like commented out attributes like "//attribute vec3 aPos;", I've already fixed it in the project itself, but I've still have to do it here :P
